            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I’m studying software engineering at Addis Ababa University, building a strong technical foundation. I
                enhance my skills through W3Schools, FreeCodeCamp, and IBM Skill Build, while connecting with fellow
                tech
                enthusiasts at Google Developer Groups (GDG) through workshops.</p>

            <p>I express my creativity through painting and drawing, exploring techniques in watercolor, acrylic, and
                charcoal. Additionally, I stay active and promote well-being by engaging in physical activities like
                yoga, running, and cycling, maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle.</p>
